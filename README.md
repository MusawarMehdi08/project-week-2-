# **Air Quality Forecasting with LSTM and ARIMA**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on forecasting air quality levels using advanced machine learning and statistical techniques. It leverages air quality data to predict pollutant concentrations, specifically targeting **NOâ‚‚ (Nitrogen Dioxide)**, a key indicator of air quality. The project employs a combination of traditional time-series modeling (ARIMA) and deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory Networks, LSTM) to achieve accurate and meaningful predictions. 

The workflow includes handling missing data, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model comparison to identify the most effective approach.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Handling**:
   - Imputation of missing values using interpolation and forward fill methods.
   - Transformation and preprocessing of raw data for compatibility with models.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization of pollutant trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
   - Insights into how time-based features (hour, day, month) influence air quality.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extraction of time-based features (hour, day, month).
   - Use of rolling statistics and lag features to capture temporal dependencies.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Implementation of LSTM for capturing long-term dependencies in air quality data.
   - ARIMA model for benchmarking performance with traditional statistical methods.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Comparative plots of actual vs. predicted pollutant levels.
   - Highlighting trends, model accuracy, and forecast performance.

6. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Evaluation using metrics such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
